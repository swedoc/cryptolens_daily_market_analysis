        <td>Shows some rotation or preference away from ETH vs BTC, or ETH being more sensitive to negative noise. May reflect weaker conviction among ETH holders short‚Äëterm. </td>

      <tr>
        <td>Volume for ETH increased significantly (~20‚Äë25%), even while price fell.

  <h2>üß† Pattern Recognition & Interpretation</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ul>
      <li>BTC seems to be in a consolidation phase around $114‚Äë116K: gains over the past week (~+4%) have run into resistance. (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/15/what-s-next-for-bitcoin-and-ether-as-downside-fears-ease-ahead-of-fed-rate-cut?utm_source=chatgpt.com">coindesk.com</a>)</li>
      <li>ETH has attempted sharper upward moves (~+8% in past week) but is more volatile in short term. Under stress when negative news hits. (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/15/what-s-next-for-bitcoin-and-ether-as-downside-fears-ease-ahead-of-fed-rate-cut?utm_source=chatgpt.com">coindesk.com</a>)</li>
      <li>The ETH/BTC ratio is not breaking out. That suggests relative strength continues to favor Bitcoin in this moment. Investors possibly treating BTC as safer ‚Äúrisk asset‚Äù in crypto during macro uncertainty. (<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum/btc?utm_source=chatgpt.com">coingecko.com</a>)</li>
      <li>Market mood is ‚Äúhopeful but wary.‚Äù Rate cuts are priced in but not guaranteed. Any sign contradicting expectations will cause sharp reactions. Liquidity and volume are high, which means many are already positioned. That increases risk of a sharp move (up or down). </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & What to Watch</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <ul>
      <li>Fed decision: size of cut, language, forward guidance. If too dovish or weak, could spook markets.</li>
      <li>Technical resistance for BTC around $116K‚Äë$120K zone. If BTC can‚Äôt clear, then pullback possible.</li>
      <li>ETH support levels: watch where ETH holds; if heavy losses follow, momentum could shift sharply negative.</li>
      <li>Macro risks: inflation data, global economic reports, geopolitical risk. Any shocks can cascade because many positions are leveraged. </li>
    </ul>
