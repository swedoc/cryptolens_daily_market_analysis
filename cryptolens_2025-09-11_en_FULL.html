  <h1>üåê Global Snapshot</h1>
  <p>Bitcoin broke above <strong>$114,000</strong> recently, while Ethereum trades near <strong>$4,400</strong>, highlighting renewed BTC strength over ETH.

  <p>U.S. inflation fears have eased due to softer PPI data, fueling expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve‚Äîoffering the market breathing room.</p>
  <p>ETF flows show institutional capital returning to Bitcoin ETFs. For instance, BlackRock's IBIT attracted $169.5 million in inflows, offsetting outflows from other funds.

  <p>Retail investors appear more cautious, with growing signs of risk aversion and short-term bearish expectations among smaller market participants.

  <p>On-chain data reveals that whales continue to distribute BTC: more than 100,000 BTC (~$12.7 billion) moved out of large wallets in the last month, suggesting short-term selling pressure despite ongoing long-term accumulation.

  <h2>üîç Key Signals & Triggers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>BTC price above $114,000</strong><br>Why it matters: Breaks from recent consolidation; indicates buying interest from institutional and other players.<br>Impact: Short-term momentum driver; medium-term signal of strengthening BTC dominance and attracting more capital.</li>
    <li><strong>Rate cut expectations from Fed after soft PPI</strong><br>Why: Lower inflation pressure gives central banks more room to ease, favoring risk assets like crypto.<br>Impact: Bullish sentiment in the short term; medium-term potential for broader rally as liquidity increases.</li>
    <li><strong>Bitcoin ETF inflows vs. retail retreat</strong><br>Why: Institutions show confidence; retail shows fear. The divergence may stabilize price action.<br>Impact: Reduces volatility short-term; medium-term supports structural bullish case if inflows persist.</li>
    <li><strong>Whale distribution vs. long-term holding</strong><br>Why: Large BTC movements suggest profit-taking or repositioning. Simultaneously, many coins remain in illiquid addresses.<br>Impact: Bearish near-term pressure; medium-term stabilization if supply remains constrained.</li>
    <li><strong>ETH lagging BTC</strong><br>Why: Flow and attention currently favor BTC over ETH due to both sentiment and positioning.<br>Impact: Near-term downside or stagnation for ETH; medium-term recovery possible if ETH narrative re-emerges.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>üß† Pattern Recognition & Interpretation</h2>
  <p>A clear structural shift is taking place‚Äîcapital is rotating toward BTC, backed by ETF flows, while retail and altcoin participation cools. This reflects defensive, macro-sensitive positioning rather than speculative frenzy.</p>
  <p>The market remains in a holding pattern with moderate volatility and macro data (like Fed moves) acting as future catalysts. Institutions continue building exposure while whales rebalance, reinforcing a two-speed market dynamic.</p>
  <p>A reflexive loop is forming: ETF inflows drive BTC price, which draws more inflows, lowering volatility and increasing institutional conviction. The result is a cycle that supports BTC dominance in absence of altcoin catalysts.</p>
  <p>Whale activity doesn‚Äôt necessarily signal a top. Many of the coins are held long-term in illiquid wallets, meaning net sell pressure may remain contained barring a shift in macro backdrop or major crypto-specific event.</p>
  <p>The market‚Äôs vulnerability lies in deteriorating retail sentiment. Without fresh institutional flows or macro tailwinds, the ecosystem could stagnate or become fragile again.</p>
